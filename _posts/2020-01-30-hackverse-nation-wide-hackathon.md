## What is Hackverse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HackVerse serves as a platform to encourage enthusiastic minds to brainstorm on solutions for challenging issues from all over India. The unified motive of gathering all like-minded hackers to our alma mater, is what led to the creation of the idea in NITK Surathkal, the first of its kind. Weâ€™ll provide a platform for innovations, where developers can test and showcase their potential to the best of their abilities. The hackathon will also have keynotes & workshops from executives from the industry. Click here to know more about [Hackverse](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/blog/)


### Experience

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attended Hackverse hackathon at NIT Surathkal. This was my first hackathon which gave me so much experience. The conference about the blockchain, dockers, Kubernetes is wonderful. Also, the talk given by Dr. Diwakar Kamath ( Google cloud India director) was very enthusiastic, which tells us about what the current world needs.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about different tech things like Fintech, AI, cloud computing, dockers, fold, postman, etc. There are also some other talks upon Elastic, digital ocean, Wellsfargo, Matic where they talked about various open-source platforms like Kibana(java), elastic search(node js), Beats( Golang ), Logstash (java).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about our problem set in the hackathon, we planned to make CrimsonLychee, it will boost your current mood. Whether you are happy, sad, angry, surprised, it will present you with quotes, videos and posts that will improve your mood to a great extent. This application uses emotion recognition to predict the emotion of the user by scanning their face.    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This two-day hackathon gave me so much experience as it taught me how to work in a team, a time limit in a hackathon forced me to distill the visionary concepts down to actionable solutions, it built a bridge to the developer community. It has some tracks like Blockchain, AI-ML, Algorithms, FinTech, Future Mobility, AR-VR, Computer Vision, Open Innovation. Here, I got four T-shirts (Jet Brains, Matic, Devfolio, NITK Hackverse) and some schwag, thanks to Hackverse, Matic, Devfolio, Jet Brains, etc.

#### <u>What is emotion recognition?</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotive analytics is an interesting blend of psychology and technology . Though arguably reductive, many facial expression detection tools lump human emotion into 7 main categories: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Contempt, and Disgust. With facial emotion detection , algorithms detect faces within a photo or video, and sense micro expressions by analyzing the relationship between points on the face, based on curated databases compiled in academic environments.  

#### <u>How it Works</u>
* **Step1:** It will take the image of the user. The image will then be sent Affectiva API which will categorize the emotion of the user.  

* **Step2:** After detecting the emotion of the user, the app will then display quotes, posts and YouTube videos to elate the mood of the user.  

#### <u>Features</u>

* Predict the emotion of the user.
* Keep track of user's mood over time.
* If the user is sad or depressed of a considerable period of time, this application will provide him the means to get help by connecting him with a therapist.
* It also conatins the graphs so that user can keep track.

#### <u>Technology Stack</u>

* Android Studio
* Java programming
* YouTube API
* Affectiva Face Detection API
* Android NDK
* Flask API

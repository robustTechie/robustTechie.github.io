# **About Me**

Member at FOSS@Amrita, Amritapuri. Currently, I am pursuing B-tech in CSE with a specialization in AI from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I am from Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh). Seeking a position in the field of Computer Science where I can utilize my skills to further work towards personal and professional development and contribute towards the prosperity of the organization. Highly motivated and eager to learn new things.<br>
<br>
Programming always fascinated me. Developing the logic of a program is my priority rather than just random thinking. I am having a degree Diploma in Computer Management which includes a degree in Hardware, Software, and Networking. I am a keen learner. My hobbies are traveling, photography, playing guitar, playing cricket and much more.<br>

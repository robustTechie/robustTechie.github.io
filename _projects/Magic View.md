description: Magic View is a smart visual solution that helps us present and watch stuff in a very convenient way and make it movable according to our needs. The setup comes with three very compatible modules i.e. a moving IoT device, a smart remote, and a mobile application. This moving IoT device can be then used with any projector so that we can control it with either our remote or mobile application.
